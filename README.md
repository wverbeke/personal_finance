Trying to estimate how to invest personal funds:
    * Should one put money into paying off a loan?
    * Should one pay the minimum amount into a loan and instead buy stocks?
    * Something else...?

Effects to take into account:
    * Stock value increases day-by-day, and are rather volatile.
    * Inflation changes over time. Inflation determines how the value of the loan depreciates, but also affects interest rates.
    * Interest rates can change over time.
    *
